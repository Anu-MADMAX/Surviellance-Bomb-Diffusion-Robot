<h3> <b> Aim of the Project </b> </h3>
																																			
																																			
																																			
The project is basically aimed for surveillance an bomb diffusion activity without the involvement of a human physically this will ensure saving lives of living beings and cause less losses I have published my research paper in the journal in IRJET Volume 7 Issue 8 S.no. 257 [Link](https://irjet.net/archives/V7/i8/IRJET-V7I8257.pdf).

This project was made after getting inspired from the rocker bogie model which was first used in the mars curiosity rover. For mars exploration and investigation as well as different surviellance spy robots.

In the earlier project I incorporated it with bluetooth based control and maneuvering operations which helped it control over ground at a range of 429 feets approx on the first trial. 

>> Now, I want to change the control system with gsm based so that the crawler can be controlled wirelessly and globally just by sitting from any part of the world without any limitations.

>>Next upgrade which I am looking for in it is the incorporation of GPS system so that we can locate it from a place and keep a track of it from anywhere.

>>Also, I'm Open to other upgradations in my project if you are willing to contribute in this open source project so, do mark your presence my contributing in it  â˜º!!
