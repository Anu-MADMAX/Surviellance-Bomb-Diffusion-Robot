<h1> # Surviellance & Bomb Diffusion Robot with Rocker Bogie Mechanism Two way talk feature and Human Hand Gesture Controlled Robotic Arm with Internet based navigation and Gps monitoring system </h1>

<p align="center"> DEV_Script_WOC_2020 </p>

<h3> <b> Aim of the Project üéØ </b> </h3>

The project is basically aimed for surveillance an bomb diffusion activity without the involvement of a human physically this will ensure saving lives of living beings and cause less losses I have published my research paper in the journal in IRJET Volume 7 Issue 8 S.no. 257 [Link](https://irjet.net/archives/V7/i8/IRJET-V7I8257.pdf).

This project was made after getting inspired from the rocker bogie model which was first used in the mars curiosity rover by NASA. For mars exploration and investigation as well as different surviellance spy robots.

<h3> <b> Earlier Now üí¨ </b> </h3>

In the earlier project I incorporated it with bluetooth based control using module HC-05 and maneuvering operations which helped it control over ground at a range of 429 feets approx on the first trial.
The range of the arm is around 800m to 1 km and used a sensor NRF24L01 which is a transreciever circuit, MPU 6050 which is a three axis gyrometer, Arduino pro mini, and that of camera I used a Mi 360 degree which works over wifi on 2.5 Ghz band frequency.
Keep in mind this project is based on Arduino only.

<h3> <b> Changes Required ‚úç </b> </h3>

>>Now, I want to replace the control system with a Internet based control or a wifi enabled system so that the crawler can be controlled wirelessly and globally just by sitting from any part of the world without any limitations.

>>Next upgrade which I am looking for in it, is the incorporation of GPS system so that we can get accurate pin point locations and locate it from a place and keep a track of it from anywhere.

>>Internet controlled robotic arm

>>Also, I'm Open to other upgradations in my project üëÄ .

<h3> <b> Where Will the Changes Head Us To üöÄ </b> </h3>

>>Control of the robot can be done without any limitations and serve a major purpose in military for surveillance and bomb diffusion purpose.

>>Location can easily be tracked through GPS and satellites to get the location updates which was not present in its predecessor.
