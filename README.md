In the earlier project I incorporated it with bluetooth based control and maneuvering operations which helped it control over ground at a range of 429 feets approx on the first trial.

Now, I want to change the control system with gsm based so that the crawler can be controlled wirelessly and globally just by sitting from any part of the world.
