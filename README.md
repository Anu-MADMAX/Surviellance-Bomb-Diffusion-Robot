************************************************************************DEV_Script_WOC***************************************************************************

<u><h3> Aim of the Project </h3></u>
The project is basically aimed for surveillance an bomb diffusion activity without the involvement of a human physically this will ensure saving lives of living beings and cause less losses I have published my research paper in the journal in IRJET Volume 7 Issue 8 S.no. 257.



In the earlier project I incorporated it with bluetooth based control and maneuvering operations which helped it control over ground at a range of 429 feets approx on the first trial. 

>> Now, I want to change the control system with gsm based so that the crawler can be controlled wirelessly and globally just by sitting from any part of the world.

>>Next upgrade which I am looking for in it is the incorporation of GPS system so that we can locate it from a place and keep a track of it from anywhere.

>>Also, I'm Open to other upgradations in my project if you are willing to contribute in this open source project so do make your presence my contributing in it !!
